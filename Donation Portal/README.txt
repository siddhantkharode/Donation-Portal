The React Project conatins the front end code.
Install react in your machine.
To get this code running, run the following commands in the root folder of the project.

1. npm install
(this creates the node_modules directory and the package-lock.json file. Make sure you have an internet connection when you run this command)
2. npm start
(This runs the front end code at port 3000. If everything goes well, your default browser should open up directly with this code running)


The SpringBoot Project contains the back end code.
Preferably use the STS IDE for this. If not, make sure to download Maven separately and add the required path to your machine's environment variables.
To get this code running, run the following commands in the root folder of the project.

1. mvn clean install
(This cleans and builds the project)
2. mvn spring-boot:run
(This runs the back end code at port 8080)
